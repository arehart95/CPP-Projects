# CPP-Projects
All of the CPP projects I've completed as a CPP student and learner. They vary in complexity and difficulty. 

Object Oriented Programming was the second class I enrolled in, and Data Structures & Algorithms was the third.

A folder not in OOP or Data Structuers & Algorithms belongs to the first C++ class I enrolled in which was the
language fundamentals. At the time I was enrolled only in that class and so they have not been grouped into a
higher order folder.
